Telco Company X experienced elevated customer churn in its California branch over the last quarter. This project analyzes customer behavior and service attributes to quantify the impact of churn, identify high-risk customer segments, and uncover key factors associated with churn.

Using customer demographics, contract details, service usage, and CLTV, the analysis focuses on answering practical business questions: Who is churning, where is churn concentrated, and which factors most strongly differentiate churned vs retained customers?

The outcome is an analytical report that supports stakeholder decision-making by highlighting churn risk patterns and prioritizing opportunities for retention strategies.
